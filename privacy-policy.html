        <h1>ClipboardX Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 6 March 2024</p>

        <h2>Owner and Operator of ClipboardX</h2>
        <p>The desktop application ClipboardX and the related website clipboardx.app (the “Website”) are owned and operated by ClipboardX Team (“we”, “us”, and “our”).</p>

        <h2>Screen Recording and Screenshot Features</h2>
        <p>ClipboardX provides users with an easier way to create screen recordings and take screenshots for their personal use. These recordings and screenshots are saved locally on your Mac in the <code>~/Library/ScreenRecordings</code> folder or copied to your clipboard. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any data from your screen recordings or screenshots. All content remains solely on your device unless you choose to share it.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>ClipboardX stores your data (clipboard history, pinboard items, etc.) locally on your Mac. This data is not transferred to or stored on our servers, nor do we have access to, own, or use this data in any other manner.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>ClipboardX requires certain permissions to function correctly, such as access to your clipboard, screen recording capabilities, and screenshot functionalities. These permissions are used solely to provide the intended features of the app. We do not collect or transmit any personal data through these permissions.</p>

        <h2>Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>If ClipboardX crashes, we collect anonymized data to help us identify and fix the issue in a future update. This data includes information about the app version, operating system, and device you’re using but does not include any personal data or content from your clipboard, screen recordings, or screenshots.</p>
        <p>We use Firebase for crash reporting.</p>

        <h2>Usage Analytics</h2>
        <p>We collect anonymized information about how you use ClipboardX to help us improve the application. This data cannot identify you personally and includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and model;</li>
            <li>Operating system version;</li>
            <li>Language and region settings;</li>
            <li>Application version;</li>
            <li>Events performed within the app (e.g., “user accessed screen recording feature”);</li>
            <li>Error codes and messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use analytics services like Firebase to collect, store, and analyze this data. Additionally, we measure and analyze usage on our website using Plausible.</p>

        <p>When you make payments related to ClipboardX, the payments are processed by third parties such as Apple or other payment processors. We do not collect your payment data and do not have access to it. Please refer to the privacy policies of the respective payment processors for more details.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>We do not use any cookies on the Website or ClipboardX.</p>

        <h2>Support Interactions</h2>
        <p>When you contact us for support, we collect your email address, name, and any other information you provide in your message to assist you. This data is collected solely to resolve your inquiry. If you’d like your communications removed, please let us know.</p>

        <p>We use SendGrid for sending newsletters and transactional emails.</p>

        <h1>ClipboardX Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 6 March 2024</p>

        <h2>Owner and Operator of ClipboardX</h2>
        <p>The desktop and mobile applications ClipboardX (collectively, “ClipboardX”) and the related website clipboardx.app (the “Website”) are owned and operated by ClipboardX Team (“we”, “us”, and “our”).</p>
        <p>When we ask you to provide us with your personal data or if you contact us, we act as a data controller regarding your personal data. This means that we are responsible for deciding what personal data can be collected from you and how it can be used.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>ClipboardX stores your data (clipboard history, pinboard items, etc.) locally on your Mac or iOS device. If you use iCloud Sync, ClipboardX stores a copy of your data in your personal iCloud storage to synchronize it across your devices automatically. You can disable iCloud Sync in ClipboardX’s preferences.</p>
        <p>This data is not transferred to or stored on our servers, nor do we have access to, own, or use this data in any other manner.</p>
        <p>ClipboardX also stores your subscription information in your iCloud storage to allow you to use it on all your devices. You always have the option to disable ClipboardX’s access to iCloud in your device’s preferences.</p>

        <h2>Usage Analytics</h2>
        <p>We collect anonymized information about how you use ClipboardX to help us improve the application. This data cannot identify you personally and includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymized user ID;</li>
            <li>Device type, model, and identifier;</li>
            <li>Operating system;</li>
            <li>Language;</li>
            <li>Country, region, city;</li>
            <li>Application version;</li>
            <li>Subscription status and duration;</li>
            <li>Events performed within the app (e.g., “user completed onboarding”);</li>
            <li>Error codes and messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use analytics services like Mixpanel, Firebase, and ASATools to collect, store, and analyze this data. Additionally, we measure and analyze usage on our website using Plausible.</p>

        <h2>Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>If ClipboardX crashes, we collect anonymized data to help us identify and fix the issue in a future update. This data includes information about the app, operating system, and device you’re using but does not include your personal data.</p>
        <p>We use Firebase for crash reporting.</p>

        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>When you make payments related to ClipboardX, the payments are processed by third parties such as Apple or other payment processors. We do not collect your payment data and do not have access to it. Please refer to the privacy policies of the respective payment processors for more details.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>We do not use any cookies on the Website or ClipboardX.</p>

        <h2>Support Interactions</h2>
        <p>When you contact us for support, we collect your email address, name, and any other information you provide in your message to assist you. This data is collected to resolve your inquiry. If you’d like your communications removed, please let us know.</p>
        <p>We use Help Scout for customer support and Gmail for personal communication.</p>

        <h2>Marketing Messages</h2>
        <p>If you subscribe to our newsletter, provide consent for commercial communication, or enter into a contract with us, we may send you messages about new features or special offers. You can opt-out at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email. Additionally, you may receive important technical notices, which are not considered commercial messages and cannot be opted out from.</p>
        <p>We use SendGrid for sending newsletters and transactional emails.</p>

        <h2>Managing Your Data</h2>
        <p>You have rights over your personal data, including:</p>
